In multipage web application, a request is send to the server by the client, as a result the server returns the html+css+js of the corresponding pages requested, which is rendered in users browser. In this for every page request is send again and again.
But in single page web application, a request is send to the server by the client, as a result the server returns the html + css + bundle of js, and from here on js take over the controll and populates the same page with different content based on the page requested(may be some content remain same in all pages), using api.

------------------------------------------------------------

node_modules folder is not given to and customer after development. It can be recreated using package-lock.json and package.json, by writing 
---> npm install 
in terminal.
so, we palce node_modules folder in .gitignore.

https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/
bootstrap js:
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-YvpcrYf0tY3lHB60NNkmXc5s9fDVZLESaAA55NDzOxhy9GkcIdslK1eN7N6jIeHz" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

bootstrap css:
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-QWTKZyjpPEjISv5WaRU9OFeRpok6YctnYmDr5pNlyT2bRjXh0JMhjY6hW+ALEwIH" crossorigin="anonymous">

add these two in index.html of public folder to include js and css.
when you get components from bootstrap </>, (class --> className), (for --> htmlFor) and (href="#" --> href="/") changes are necessary. And component should be pasted inside return for JSX in App.js
for every anchoer tag href is necessary.
public folder is publically available, so dont put secrets in that folder.
We will optimize the developer build and deploy that production build in server not this developer build
--> npm run build
